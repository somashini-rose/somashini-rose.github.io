      <h2> Emotional Intelligence </h2>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What is Emotional Intelligence?</span><br>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, understand, manage and express your emotions in a healthy manner.<br>
        It is the recognition, understanding and influencing the emotions of others. People with a high EQ make great leader and team players because they are able to empathise and connect with those around them.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">How is it different to IQ?</span><br>
        Both EQ and IQ can impact your relationships, professional life and your wellbeing. Where EQ focuses on recognition and management of emotions in yourself and others.<br>
        IQ is your intelligence level, your ability to understand and apply information, logical reasoning, word comprehension and maths skills.<br>
        IQ is an inborn ability whereas EQ is a learned and improved ability.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Why is it important?</span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic">"If you do not manage your emotions, your emotions will manage you.”</span> - Deborah Rozman (Psychologist and Author). <br>
        Your emotions precede thought, so when your emotions are in a heightened state they change the way your brain functions affecting the decisions you make and communication skills.<br>
        By recognising, understanding and managing your emotions we can be more successful in both your professional and personal life. </p>

        <p>EQ is important in a both a personal and professional capacity, you are better able to have those uncomfortable conversation without offending or hurting feelings, managing your emotions when in a state of stress or feeling overwhelmed, most importantly it can help build and improve your relationships.<br>
          In a professional sense EQ is super important when it comes to managing conflict, motivating others and creating a collaborative environment.</p>
