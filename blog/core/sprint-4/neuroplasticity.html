      <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h2>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Neuroplasticity</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to change and adapt. It benefits people by promoting the ability to learn new things, enhance cognitive capabilities, strengthen areas where function is lost or has declined. Without neuroplasticity it would be difficult to learn or improve brain function. The principles of neuroplasticity are fundamental in helping to guide, improve and promote progress in brain functionality.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me to see the benefits of engaging in the principles of neuroplasticity, I need to ensure I am getting enough sleep and engaging my brain in a meaningful way utilising memory training exercises, using my non-dominant hand for tasks, but most importantly by repetition - learning and repeating a new skill or task.  
      </p>

      <p> 
        There are a number of ways to promote and increase neuroplasticity, some of the most common and easy to do ways are: 
        <ul>
          <li>Travel - by exposing your brain to new, novel and complex environments</li>
          <li>Memory training - promotes connectivity in the brains prefrontal area which can also slow down memory loss with age</li>
          <li>Non-dominant hand exercises - by using your non-dominant hand for simple tasks you are helping your brain form new neural pathways.</li>
        </ul>   
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Growth Mindset</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Having a growth mindset means you believe you can improve/learn new skills through effort and practice. This mindset is particularly helpful to students as it makes them more open to new
        information and learning.  It can help overcome obstacles when learning something new or developing a new skill.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Going through this material straight after a big week of new skill development and into another week of challenges using JS was super beneficial in helping me not get to overwhelmed by what I do not know, yet, and I can get better it just requires practice and effort. Basically, a nice reminder that you can learn anything you just need to start.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I will strive to integrate a growth mindset in my learning journey by continuing to challenge myself, exercises to build neuroplasticty and mindfulness during this journey. Reminding myself that I don't need to know everything about everything right now 'not yet' is an okay place to be.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Problem-solving Techniques/Processes:</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        My first option used to be straight to google but as we have gone through the different research projects, I feel more confident using: Pseudocoding, trying and testing, talking to my little Kiwi desktop buddy (it's a plushie) and then resorting to Google. The other techniques (reading error messages, console.logging, asking your peers for help, asking coaches for help, improving your process with reflection) I have tried but maybe haven't used enough yet to feel confident using them. yet.
