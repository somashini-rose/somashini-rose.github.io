      <p>
        I mean I have a lot of problems when it comes to coding but this week the one that tripped me up and sent me spiralling was...a missing comma when nesting an object within an object. 
        I sat there staring at my screen for a while, I started trying other fixes as I thought I had not completed the code properly (lots of swearing and googling took place here), tried commenting out the code to back track to where I went wrong and started looking at what a google example showed me and what I had on my screen line by line and lo and behold, there was my missing comma - see simple right! This process was quite frustrating, I felt quite silly at the end, but I did learn to slow down a little and pay attention a bit more instead of racing through.

        Katas!!!!! All the problems really, the last kata on built-in methods specifically the deBee challenge was difficult to understand what was going on at first, I started by console logging what the string looked like, I tried a few different things here and got nowhere. I resorted to check out the hints.js which helped set me on a different path. I used google ALOT for this challenge, I only use this example of being elegant because the code I started with was way to long and over complicated everything, in the end it looked better and was easier to undersatnd.

        My first option used to be straight to google but as we have gone through the different research projects, I feel more confident using: Pseudocoding, trying and testing, talking to my little Kiwi desktop buddy (it's a plushie) and then resorting to Google. The other techniques (reading error messages, console.logging, asking your peers for help, asking coaches for help, improving your process with reflection) I have tried but maybe haven't used enough yet to feel confident using them. yet.
