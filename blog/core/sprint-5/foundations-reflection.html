      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't enjoy being out of my depth, I struggle to ask for help lest it be seen as weak or incompetent, I have the capacity to learn and grow in all aspects by applying the 'not yet' principal.
      </p>


      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Not having the clearest of values at the start, well thats what I thought I quickly came to realise I have some strong values centered around people and helping which was helpful during this course to talk to others and help where I could but also be a little vulnerable. Empathy has a huge role to play in both learning and programming, you need tons of it for yourself and the learning journey on but also to work with others, empathy helps to connect and relate to people in a similar situation. Having self-awareness goes a long way in making sure you keep the negative voices at bay, understanding where your strengths and more importantly your weaknesses are to continue to learn and develop in that area.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        A growth vs. fixed mindset and how they both have a place but my greatest learning and something that will stick with me is the 'not yet' principal especially going into bootcamp feeling apprehensive about what awaits.
      </p>


      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Stopping to reflect on the core we were learning but also just in general not just moving onto the next challenge but taking a moment to go through what you learned and what you can take away. The work at the start around values and identity was a lil tough. 
      </p>


      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        We live in a world were we need to connect with people on a daily basis, at school and uni we are taught all the tech skills the intellect side 'book smarts' but not how to play nicely in different settings where we may work with a variety of personalities and situations. Core skills is like the human version of JavaScript - its what makes us interactive with others, which employers want more than just the tech skills. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</span>
      </p>

      <p> 
        No, not at all. Yes it would be nice to have more time to practice the tech side of things, however given the fast paced nature things like having the growth minset work ahead of the JavaScript intro by fire week was beneficial to get through and not feel too overwhelmed. Neuroplasticity was another incredibly valuable area to explore.
