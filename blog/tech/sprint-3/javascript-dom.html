<div class="about">
<h2>Welcome to JavaScript 101 the Amateur Edition</h2>
  
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</span></p>
    <p>While researching JavaScript I came across a pretty cool analogy which is by far my favourite. <br>
    In this analogy we liken a website to a human body.<br>
    HTML is the structure or skelton, the bones if your will. It holds everything together and provides a base to hang everything off.<br>
    CSS is the skin, the outside appearance the thing other humans can touch and feel the tangible element<br>
    With just these two elements alone you can have a funtional pretty website, but if you want it to do more than just basic functionality you need JavaScript.<br>
    JavaScript ('JS') is the thing that pulls it all together, in our analogy JS is the muscles in the human body it provides motion and behaviour, it acts out the heavy lifting. JS takes your basic, pretty looking body up a notch and makes it interactive.</p>
      
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What is Control Flow and Loops?</span></p>
    <p>Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to bottom. <br>
      It starts from the first line and ends at the last line, unless it hits any statement that changes the flow of the program such as loops, conditionals, or functions.
      An example of a control flow is using a recipe, you start reading and following a recipe from top to bottom in sequentuial order, sometimes that flow is interrupted by a choice or substitution of an ingrediant or method (conditional - if/else statement). <br>
      Once the condition has been met the flow continues in sequential order.</p>

    <p>Loops are iteration statements that will keep running until there is either nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false.</p>
      
   <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What is The DOM and how you can interact with it?</span></p>
   <p>The Document Object Model ('DOM') is a tree-like representation (very hierachical) of the web page that gets loaded into the browser.</p>
      
   <img src="/../../images/screenshots/DOM_structure.webp" alt="DOM hierachical structure">

   <p>It is a web API through which JavaScript interacts with HTML. There are many properties and methods which you can use to get information about the DOM and manipulate it.<br>
    You use the API directly in JavaScript from within what is called a script, a program run by a browser. When you create a script, whether inline in a script element or by linking a web page. </p>
      
   <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Accessing data from arrays and objects.</span></p>
   <p> Both objects and arrays are considered “special” in JavaScript. Objects and arrays can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value) in a container.<br>
    Objects are used to represent a “thing” e.g. aperson, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. 
    In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value. </p>

    <p>Basic object syntax: <br>
      <img src="/../../images/screenshots/Object.png" alt="Object code"> </p>

    <p>Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation.<br>
      To get the value of the age key in our personobject with both dot and bracket notation:
    <img src="/../../images/screenshots/Access_Object.png" alt="Acessing Object code"></p>

    <p>Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.</p>
    <p>Basic array:
      <img src="/../../images/screenshots/Array.png" alt="Array code"> </p>

    <p>Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on. If we wanted to access the third item (Mexico City) in the array shown above:
      <img src="/../../images/screenshots/Access_Array.png" alt="Accesing an Array code"></p>
      
   <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What are Functions and why are they helpful</span></p>
   <p>A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
    Functions allow you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want, which is useful in avoiding duplication of code making it easier to fix bugs etc. 
   </p>
