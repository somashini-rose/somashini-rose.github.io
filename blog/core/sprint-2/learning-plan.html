      <h2> Learning Plan </h2>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</span><br>
        My career pathway is to move into software development, at this stage that is full-stack development (always subject to change).</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</span><br>
        One of my strengths is resilience and once I've decided on a path I will do everything in my power to follow it while keeping an eye out for improvements and changes that may be required along the way.  A frustrating limitation is my tendency to procrastinate when I am unsure of my ability or I fear failure, this is frustrating as I know once I start I will be fine.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span><br>
        Self-belief and confidence in my abilities and knowledge.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</span><br>
        I will use tools such as Toggl to track my time to ensure I am making the best use of my time and follow the EDA process, which I have found helpful when I find myself procrastinating. 
        I have started to block out times in my calendar for study sessions and my phone is set to do not disturb to limit distractions.
      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic"> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you: </span><br>
        Take a deep breath, take a break, use google when it makes sense to (but not falling into a rabbit hole) and when I can't figure something out using Discord to connect with my peers and ask for help (if the question hasn’t already been answered), or speaking to my facilitator. </p>
      	
      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way: </span><br>
        My commitment is that I won't sit staring at my screen trying work out a problem for more than 15 mins without either taking a break to process and when that does not work turning to Discord - my peers and facilitators for assistance.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</span><br>
        My expectation for the facilitation team is that they understand the content, are able to explain it in a simplified way with examples when required but mostly to support and facilitate my learning journey in the most practical and effective way possible.</p>
      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span><br>
        I have blocked out Tue, The, Sun nights from 6:00pm onwards to have time with friends, self care etc. and during the day to take a lunch break during which I will either exercise or get outside for a walk at least.</p>
