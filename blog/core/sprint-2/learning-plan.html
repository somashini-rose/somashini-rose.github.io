      <h2> Bootcamp Learning Plan </h2>

      <p>
        My career path is one that leads me into being a fullstack developer in a creative area of the sector, I may not be the most creative but I thrive working in an environment with creative personalities. My goal is have a role that fits with a balance of working to live and living to work, I would like to be able to work overseas for a time to gain more experience in different arenas. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As I haved moved through the last 5 weeks of foundations I have found myself speaking more positively toward myself and my abilities than when I started, I wish to continue this growth through continual practice and stretching myself and my capabilities. I am still working on the procrastination, however I do not believe this will be a problem during BootCamp. My strength of resilience has come in handy and will continue to do as we move into the next part of this learning journey. I am concerned about mainitaining focus and productivity for a full intense 9 weeks, but will utilise tools such as meditations, mindfullness and reflection to draw on what we have learnt to stay on track as well as taking regular breaks. I would like to contiue to developing my human skills in self-belief and awareness as well as pair programming. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Support from the Dev Academy BootCamp team will be vital to my success, being able to tap into their knowledge in both the technical and core areas. 
        However, during BootCamp and this journey most of that responsibility falls to me as a student to create a stucture to most benefit from the content, this has already started by letting friends know I will be offline for the next 9 weeks. It will be my responsibility and committment to my journey to ask for help, using the resources provided and ustilising the facilitators and my peers knowledge as well. 
      </p>

      <h2> Foundation Learning Plan </h2>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</span><br>
        My career pathway is to move into software development, at this stage that is full-stack development (always subject to change).
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</span><br>
        One of my strengths is resilience and once I've decided on a path I will do everything in my power to follow it while keeping an eye out for improvements and changes that may be required along the way. A frustrating limitation is my tendency to procrastinate when I am unsure of my ability or I fear failure, this is frustrating as I know once I start I will be fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span><br>
        Self-belief and confidence in my abilities and knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives</span><br>
        I will use tools such as Toggl to track my time to ensure I am making the best use of my time and follow the EDA process, which I have found helpful when I find myself procrastinating. I have
        started to block out times in my calendar for study sessions and my phone is set to do not disturb to limit distractions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</span><br>
        Take a deep breath, take a break, use google when it makes sense to (but not falling into a rabbit hole) and when I can't figure something out using Discord to connect with my peers and ask for help (if the question has not already been answered), or speaking to my facilitator.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</span><br>
        My commitment is that I won't sit staring at my screen trying work out a problem for more than 15 mins without either taking a break to process and when that does not work turning to Discord, my peers and facilitators for assistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</span><br>
        My expectation for the facilitation team is that they understand the content, are able to explain it in a simplified way with examples when required but mostly to support and facilitate my learning journey in the most practical and effective way possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-style: italic">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span><br>
        I have blocked out Tue, The, Sun nights from 6:00pm onwards to have time with friends, self care etc. and during the day to take a lunch break during which I will either exercise or get outside for a walk at least.
